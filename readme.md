# Commander Masters

I spent the whole day along with a couple of friends to refine an estimated value calculator for this set. 

Wizards made it as complicated as they could with their multiple dimensional distributions, but in the end it could all be translated into regular probabilities. 

Each product has it's own distribution for all the slots in their respective boosters and I will detail them like this:

( For this calculation all cards of value less than $1 are taken as if they were valued at $0 )
